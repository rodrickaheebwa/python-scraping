GETTING STARTED
- Consider holding one or even two calls with clients before the contract is started.
- Consider documenting expectations, budget, and scope, so everyone is on the same page.
- Consider building a checklist for the above for every project.
- Consider taking note of things that work and things that need improvement.
- Remember, this is a sale, focus on how the client benefits.
- Set clear project deliverables, budgets, and expectations.
- Keep the client informed on progress and ensure they are comfortable with the process.

- Consider asking, how would you like me to communicate with you? Do you prefer phone calls, email, or zoom meetings? Additionally, consider how frequently they want to communicate – are weekly check-ins ideal? Or do they prefer bi-weekly? Or maybe they like intermittent check-ins based on the project timeline.
- Does the client prefer back-and-forth discussions, visual presentations, reviewing data, or short updates? Based on your client's preferred style, be sure to tailor your meeting plan so they’ll be more receptive to the information.
- After the meeting, be sure to send a recap of your discussion. This reinforces what was discussed and aligns any tasks and deadlines.
- To build trust, it’s important to be transparent, clear, and honest while working on a project. Whether you have good or bad news, be direct and share how you plan to address it head-on. If timelines need to change or something is delayed, communicate quickly and be transparent.
- It’s important to ask questions when you have them, especially when they can help clarify any details and ensure you and your client are on the same page.
- The best way to end a project relationship is by asking for feedback.

- Use project tracking and management tools like Trello, Asana.

- Try to focus on one task at a time and complete it fully before moving on to the next.
- Consider taking frequent breaks between tasks to stay alert and motivated.
- Check off each task as you complete it, and at the end of the day, take a few moments to review your list and celebrate your victories.
- Take a few moments in the morning to review your list and reprioritize it if necessary.
- Writing out a list by hand on paper allows your brain to engage with the information far more than typing on a keyboard.
- Plan your work week in advance.
- A good practice is to track your time as you complete tasks to better understand your work pace.

- If a client does not close a project, feel free to do so on your end and leave feedback for your client. Receiving feedback from you may encourage them to reciprocate, and they’ll have 14 days to leave a review.

- I hope that you are as pleased as I am with the outcome of this project! If you get a chance, I’d appreciate your feedback!
- I would appreciate any feedback you have! This helps me ensure that I continue delivering great work to clients.

FINDING WORK
There are two main ways that independent professionals find work on the Marketplace.
1. You can search for opportunities that clients have posted and submit proposals to try to win the job. Choose jobs you feel competent enough to do.
2. A client may invite you to submit a proposal or interview for a job. This requires that you have specialty in some fields and you've delivered enough times.

Cover letter:
- warm and professional greeting, and use client's name if possible
- pitch, skills you have that make you the person for the job, how the client will benefit
- where they can find more about your work and experience
"I'm interested in your job posting about <job> and have these skills <skills> necessary for the job, you can find my portfolio here <portfolio>."
- link your work experience with their needs
- include anything the client considers crucial
- give your availability and let the client know you are ready to discuss further, and importantly, how the client can proceed to talk to you, e.g. message room, zoom...
- keep the focus not on what you can do, but what the client is looking for
